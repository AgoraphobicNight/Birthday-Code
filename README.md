### Notes

- This project was just a fun virtual birthday message that I thought others would enjoy. Feel free to use it for yourself! I’ve included comments in the code to assist those who may not be code-savvy.
- Please note that I aimed for simplicity, so it’s a basic birthday message without extensive features.
